      <description>Pomodoro Technique I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about it before. Recently I dusted off my old method and tried to implement it. I found that there were some rather strange problems with my old method and MacOS. So I wanted to help some people.
The scripts We have a few scripts. We have a delayed_mac script. This script just takes a command and a time in mins. It executes the command that many mins later.</description>

      <description>The Architecture of Open Source Applications If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen or read The Architecture of Open Source Applications then you are missing out. Sure, it is a bit long. Also, each section is written by a different writer making it slightly inconsistent. But, there are gems throughout the book that make it worth the read.
One of the gems Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of one of the gems from the Berkeley DB section.</description>

      <description>Subject Why should we have blameless postmortems?
Context I recently read a blog post about blameless postmortems from Etsy. In it there was a simple question about why software engineers shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be punished:
Why shouldn’t they be punished or reprimanded? Because an engineer who thinks they’re going to be reprimanded are disincentivized to give the details necessary to get an understanding of the mechanism, pathology, and operation of the failure. This lack of understanding of how the accident occurred all but guarantees that it will repeat.</description>

      <description>The problem I want to write code that is consistently shared with the rest of the team, but I also want trunk based development.
What is branch by abstraction Paul Hammant a friend and mentor of mine, has two great articles explaining branch by abstraction here and here. The basic concept is pretty easy. Instead of having long lived branches in your version control system, you simply create an abstraction that allows you to change the behavior with only a few minor changes.</description>
