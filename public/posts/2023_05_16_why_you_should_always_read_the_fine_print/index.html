                    <p>I was driving a truck in Iraq when the first IED exploded. I remember seeing the vehicle in front of me burst into flames and feeling the heat come through the steering wheel. My world went quiet, and everything felt distant like I was seeing the world through a fishbowl.</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, someone was screaming at me to drive. I snapped out of my daze and hit the gas pedal. We drove as fast as we could to the nearest forward operating base.</p>
<p>That moment changed me. I had joined the Marines without fully reading the contract, and I had been assigned to be a truck driver without much say in the matter. See when I signed up in 2003 truck drivers were not reenlisting. The USMC found it cheaper to train computer technicians to drive trucks then to find more recruits.  I loved serving my country, but that experience made me realize that I needed to be more aware of what I was signing up for.</p>
<p>From then on, I made a promise to myself never to sign anything without fully understanding it. I started to read contracts thoroughly, even the fine print. I wanted to be informed and aware of what I was getting into.</p>
<p>That moment in Iraq was a turning point in my life. It taught me the importance of being informed and making decisions with clarity and purpose. I realized that it&rsquo;s not just about signing a piece of paper - it&rsquo;s about understanding what you&rsquo;re signing up for and taking responsibility for your choices. Whether it&rsquo;s a job, a lease, or any other kind of agreement, it&rsquo;s crucial to read the fine print and ask questions when you&rsquo;re unsure.</p>
<p>By doing so, you&rsquo;re taking control of your life and ensuring that you&rsquo;re making informed decisions that align with your goals and values. You&rsquo;re setting yourself up for success and empowering yourself to achieve great things. So, always take the time to read the fine print - it could be the difference between just going through the motions and truly living a purposeful life.</p>
<p>This applies to start-ups as well. If you are founding a company or are a leader you should understand the fine print. It&rsquo;s important and can save you a lot of time and money. I&rsquo;ve seen many start-ups fail because they didn&rsquo;t read the fine print. They didn&rsquo;t understand the legal or business implications of their decisions and ended up in a bad situations.</p>
