                <section id="post-body">
                    <p>Recently I had a problem with <a href="http://charltonaustin.blogspot.com/">my old blog</a> where writing new blog posts would be buggy. Things like code formatting wouldn&rsquo;t be consistent and so I moved to images of code. Which is so silly considering that it is just text. I&rsquo;ve always had a bit of a problem with blogspot. I disliked the lack of control over how things are displayed and served up content. I knew that I wanted to move to HTTPS and that I was tired of working within the confines of WYSIWYG editors. So I took the plunge and decided to create a new clojure app and bought some hosting on <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>.</p>
<h2 id="markdown-for-the-win">Markdown for the win</h2>
<p>I decided that I wanted to keep two repositories for my blog. One that was just the <a href="https://github.com/charltonaustin/blog-entries">content</a> and a second one a <a href="https://github.com/charltonaustin/blog">webpage</a> to display that content. I briefly toyed with the idea of using github pages, but in the end I decided against it because I was interested in keeping track of the number of visitors to my website and having a place for comments. It took some time to find the time to actually get everything moved over, but now that I&rsquo;ve moved it I&rsquo;m really happy with the solution. As it stands if I want to update the blog I simply update the content and within a few mins I see the updates on my webpage.</p>
<h2 id="clojure-and-luminus">Clojure and Luminus</h2>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had a chance to use <a href="http://www.luminusweb.net/">Luminus</a> before you should give it a spin. I&rsquo;ve written servers in everything Struts to Spring to Dropwizard and I like Luminus a lot. The docs are great and it has been a joy to write Clojure. Everything from actually writing the app to deploying was pretty smooth. The one thing that still drives me crazy in Clojure is debugging. Writing a Clojure app can be challenging depending on what editor or IDE you are using. The learning curve of emacs can be steep, but once you&rsquo;ve got it figured out debugging comes pretty easily and honestly writing code is a joy.</p>
<h2 id="nginx-and-lets-encrypt">NGINX and Let&rsquo;s Encrypt</h2>
<p>The webserver I&rsquo;m using is NGINX. Setting it up is pretty straightforward. There are some great docs both at <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04-lts">Digital Ocean</a> and at <a href="http://www.luminusweb.net/docs/deployment.md#fronting_with_nginx">Luminus</a>. I also used certbot from the <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">EFF</a>. I love that I can enforce HTTPS using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS</a>. While I do want to keep track of how many visitors I have I don&rsquo;t really care about their personal information and I think at this point every one pretty much agrees we should be using SSL for everything. One thing that I will probably blog about in the future is how to set up auto cert updates, but with certbot that might not be necessary as the instructions look pretty straight forward.</p>
<h2 id="finally-its-all-updated">Finally it&rsquo;s all updated</h2>
<p>Now that it is all updated I should get some of the back logged posts that I have out and start updating this thing more regularly. Also I really want to make some more blog posts about what I&rsquo;m teaching my students and JavaScript.</p>
