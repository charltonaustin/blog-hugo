      <description>Pomodoro Technique I&amp;rsquo;ve blogged about it before. Recently I dusted off my old method and tried to implement it. I found that there were some rather strange problems with my old method and MacOS. So I wanted to help some people.
The scripts We have a few scripts. We have a delayed_mac script. This script just takes a command and a time in mins. It executes the command that many mins later.</description>

      <description>Pomodoro Expanded Previously I had created a post where I talked about using the pomodoro technique on mac OSX. Well today I want to show how I have expanded on my original idea. First I created this:
#! /bin/sh at now + $1 minutes &amp;lt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt; $2 Which is a small script to run a bash command at some time in the future. Then I created this:
#!/bin/bash x=`/usr/bin/osascript &amp;lt;&amp;lt;EOT tell application &amp;#34;Finder&amp;#34; activate set myReply to text returned of (display dialog &amp;#34;Start 25 mins: Please put in task&amp;#34; default button 1 buttons {&amp;#34;OK&amp;#34;} default answer &amp;#34;&amp;#34; with icon 1) end tell EOT` echo &amp;#39;Text is: &amp;#39;$x if [[ -z &amp;#34;$x&amp;#34; ]]; then echo &amp;#34;Done for the day&amp;#34; else mkdir -p $HOME/work touch $HOME/work/daily_pomodoro.</description>

      <description>Pomodoro If you haven&amp;rsquo;t ever used the pomodoro technique then you are missing out. It is a great way to stay focused on one task at a time. It is also a good way to get yourself moving regularly. There is just one thing I don&amp;rsquo;t like about it. In order to have a good timer you usually have to have something that bothers your neighbor at work. For a while I was using my phone timer which worked okay, but I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure my work mates hated me.</description>
