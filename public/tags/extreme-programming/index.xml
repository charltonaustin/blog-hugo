      <description>There are effectively (to me anyways) an infinite number of blog posts about the benefits and costs of pairing and what pairing is and isn&amp;rsquo;t. So I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about the good and bad of pairing. I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that, like me, you want to pair and you see the benefits and costs. Instead today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how I started experimenting with pairing at my most recent job.</description>
