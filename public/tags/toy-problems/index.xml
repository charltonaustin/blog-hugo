      <description>The problem A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:
1/2	= 0.5 1/3	= 0.(3) 1/4	= 0.25 1/5	= 0.2 1/6	= 0.1(6) 1/7	= 0.(142857) 1/8	= 0.125 1/9	= 0.(1) 1/10	= 0.1  Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666&amp;hellip;, and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.</description>

      <description>The problem A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.</description>

      <description>The problem A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c, for which, a^2 + b^2 = c^2
For example, 32 + 42 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 52.
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000. Find the product abc.
Solution This solution is straight forward. We satisfy the constraint that a &amp;lt; b &amp;lt; c by incrementing up by one in each variable and then we search for the solution.</description>

      <description>The problem By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
What is the 10001 prime number?
Solution Interestingly my first attempt was the good old Sieve of Eratosthenes. However I kept getting an out of memory error from JavaScript. I was using NPM 3.10.3 and would get a no free memory error after GC. My next attempt included going piece by piece and only keeping in memory as many of the composite numbers as necessary and re walking the primes.</description>

      <description>The problem The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
1^2 + 2^2 + &amp;hellip; + 10^2 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
(1 + 2 + &amp;hellip; + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.</description>

      <description>The problem 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?
Solution Now this guy is a higher order, functional dream. I first create a function that returns a function to see if a number is divisible by another number.</description>

      <description>The problem A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
Solution Now this guy is your daily warm up kind of easy. I created two functions. The first one simply checks a number to see if it is a palindrome. The second one accepts a number finds the largest multiplication combination that is a palindrome.</description>

      <description>The problem The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?
Solution This one took a bit longer than I expected. My fist attempt was pretty naive. The idea was generate all the primes less than the number and then check if the number is divisible by the prime. At the end we simple return the largest prime number that divides the number evenly.</description>

      <description>The problem Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, &amp;hellip;
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
Solution This is a pretty straight forward problem. We generate the the Fibonacci number and as we go we can check if it isEven keeping track of the sum.</description>

      <description>The problem If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
Solution The first algorithm is super straightforward. We want to simply loop over each number between the start and the end checking if the number is a multiple of 3 or 5 and then adding that to the sum.</description>

      <title>Leaders In An Array In Clojure Basic Algorithms Part Four</title>
      <link>https://charltonaustin.com/posts/leaders-in-an-array-in-clojure-basic-algorithms-part-four/</link>

      <guid>https://charltonaustin.com/posts/leaders-in-an-array-in-clojure-basic-algorithms-part-four/</guid>
      <description>The problem Given an array of integers, print the leaders in the array. A leader is an element which is larger than all the elements in the array to its right.
Solution Is was my first attempt at coming up with a solution. Naturally I used recursion and simply walked down the array seeing if every element after it was the same.
The time complexity of this is O( n^2 ) which isn&amp;rsquo;t great.</description>
