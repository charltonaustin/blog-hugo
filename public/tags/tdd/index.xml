      <description>In a previous blog entry I talk about my recent technical challenge with CoreOS. I enjoyed my interview there so much that I started doing some reading about Go. Here&amp;rsquo;s a second book that I read that I would like to write a review about. It&amp;rsquo;s called Test-Driven Development With Go written by Yigal Duppen. You can find it on leanpub and it costs $0-14.99. I was tempted when I came across it to pay for it, but I thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a read before I pay the author (authors have to eat too).</description>

He said, &amp;ldquo;No, but it&amp;rsquo;s too early to have unit tests. The code hasn&amp;rsquo;t really settled and unit tests slow you down.&amp;rdquo;
My initial reaction in my head was &amp;ldquo;Whoa that&amp;rsquo;s silly&amp;rdquo;. But after some consideration and thinking about how code can be written, I&amp;rsquo;m beginning to see his point.</description>
