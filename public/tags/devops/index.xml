      <title>Using Quay With Multiple Dockerfiles</title>

      <description>The problem Let&amp;rsquo;s say you have the following folder layout:
app1/ app2/ shared-infra-resources/ continuous-integration/ app1/ app1.Dockerfile app2/ app2.Dockerfile And you would like to build app1.Dockerfile and app2.Dockerfile in your Docker registry.
The Solution If you are using DockerHub. Then you already can&amp;rsquo;t. DockerHub doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to specify a context separate from your Dockerfile location. At least they did not as of April 8, 2017. So you can&amp;rsquo;t specify use the continuous-integration/app2/app2.</description>

      <description>The problem One thing that I keep seeing consistently regardless of whether I&amp;rsquo;m working as a full time employee or as consultant, and that I&amp;rsquo;ve literally seen from coast to coast is developers and testers trying to simplify their local environments. Increasingly, companies are using multiple services that allow for more module pieces of software (think micro-services). This is nice because it can often simplify coding complexity and dependency graphs, but the flip side is that deployments can become more complex.</description>

      <title>Problems With Cucumber And Chef</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on getting some cucumber functional tests to run on a remote server lately and had tons of problems. The setup included using Electric Commander to run a gradle task, which in turn ran cucumber using jruby. It was lots of fun. Let me say.
This post is basically because cucumber put out a misleading &amp;ldquo;error&amp;rdquo; which when I searched google I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any help. So for anyone else who finds themselves in some similar situation.</description>

      <description>A couple of days ago I got a chance to see some friends of mine (Matt Urbanski and Jinwoo Baek) give a presentation on chef. It was fantastic. Afterward we had a sort of impromptu demo session on using Vagrant and Chef to get an apache server up and running. So this is going to be a quick tutorial on how to use Vagrant and Chef to get a functioning apache server up and running on a vm.</description>

      <description>Starting my blog again. So my blog has hopelessly become out of date. Since the last time I posted I&amp;rsquo;ve started working for ThoughtWorks, gone to India, moved to San Francisco, and finally been put onto my client. Great so now what. Since things are finally starting to settle and since my thoughts have changed on maintaining a blog I&amp;rsquo;ve decided it&amp;rsquo;s time to start blogging again. Not that anyone has read anything yet.</description>
