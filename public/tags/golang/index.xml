      <description>I had a chance for the first time in a while to write some Go. I was writing a simple web API that allowed a user to login with JWT. This blog post is going to be about some of the challenges I faced along the way. I also want to give some shout outs to other blogs that helped me get it written.

      <description>Recently I had a chance to write some Go code for the first time in a few years as part of the interview process at CoreOS. The challenge was actually really fun, but so as not to ruin surprise I won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about what I did during the challenge. Suffice it to say that I had a great experience, and whether or not I get the job at CoreOS I definitely enjoyed the interview process.</description>
