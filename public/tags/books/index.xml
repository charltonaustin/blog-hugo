      <description>The Architecture of Open Source Applications If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen or read The Architecture of Open Source Applications then you are missing out. Sure, it is a bit long. Also, each section is written by a different writer making it slightly inconsistent. But, there are gems throughout the book that make it worth the read.
One of the gems Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of one of the gems from the Berkeley DB section.</description>

      <description>In a previous blog entry I talk about my recent technical challenge with CoreOS. I enjoyed my interview there so much that I started doing some reading about Go. Here&amp;rsquo;s a second book that I read that I would like to write a review about. It&amp;rsquo;s called Test-Driven Development With Go written by Yigal Duppen. You can find it on leanpub and it costs $0-14.99. I was tempted when I came across it to pay for it, but I thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a read before I pay the author (authors have to eat too).</description>

      <description>Recently I had a chance to write some Go code for the first time in a few years as part of the interview process at CoreOS. The challenge was actually really fun, but so as not to ruin surprise I won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about what I did during the challenge. Suffice it to say that I had a great experience, and whether or not I get the job at CoreOS I definitely enjoyed the interview process.</description>
