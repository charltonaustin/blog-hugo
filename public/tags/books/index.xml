      <description>Should story points be tied to time I often hear people say story point shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be tied to time. Instead they should be based on complexity. This can be for a variety of reason. Here for instance three reasons are cited.
Some tasks are difficult to estimate precisely.
If one developer estimates a project but another completes the task, the estimate becomes invalid. The time needed to complete a task will vary based on a developerâ€™s level of experience.</description>

      <description>The Architecture of Open Source Applications If you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen or read The Architecture of Open Source Applications then you are missing out. Sure, it is a bit long. Also, each section is written by a different writer making it slightly inconsistent. But, there are gems throughout the book that make it worth the read.
One of the gems Here&amp;rsquo;s an example of one of the gems from the Berkeley DB section.</description>

      <title>A Review Of Test Driven Development With Go</title>

      <description>In a previous blog entry I talk about my recent technical challenge with CoreOS. I enjoyed my interview there so much that I started doing some reading about Go. Here&amp;rsquo;s a second book that I read that I would like to write a review about. It&amp;rsquo;s called Test-Driven Development With Go written by Yigal Duppen. You can find it on leanpub and it costs $0-14.99. I was tempted when I came across it to pay for it, but I thought maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a read before I pay the author (authors have to eat too).</description>

      <title>A Review Of An Introduction To Programming In Go</title>

      <description>Recently I had a chance to write some Go code for the first time in a few years as part of the interview process at CoreOS. The challenge was actually really fun, but so as not to ruin surprise I won&amp;rsquo;t be talking about what I did during the challenge. Suffice it to say that I had a great experience, and whether or not I get the job at CoreOS I definitely enjoyed the interview process.</description>

      <title>Make it stick</title>

      <description>The book Make It Stick is a brief review of the best methods for learning. The book starts out by giving a brief overview of how teachers have tried to teach in the past and then turns to evidence based methods backed by science today. There is some repetition in content, but I immediately tried to implement the practices in the book and found that it dramatically changed the way that I read and study.</description>
