      <description>The problem You really want to make sure that unit tests are run every time someone commits.
The solution Three simple scripts. The first should be run by all engineers that join the team. It should do most of the installs for environment dependencies. The second should be a pre-commit script. This script should run your tests and anything else that you want to have happen. The third script should be an update script.</description>
