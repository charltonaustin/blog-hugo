      <description>Recently I read a report from the 2018 stack overflow survey, here.
From the survey:
 Only tiny fractions of developers say that they would write unethical code or that they have no obligation to consider the ethical implications of code, but beyond that, respondents see a lot of ethical gray.
 Given the recent investigation into Facebook. I thought it might be prudent to do a little thinking and writing about what it means to write code ethically.</description>
