      <description>Note This was written mostly immediately after I joined CoreOS and then updated this last week. I recently started working at CoreOS and one thing that they do there for every change of code is a code review. I have never had code reviews before. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly worked in environments where I have paired directly with people. So I wanted to do a quick review on the differences between the two methods.</description>

      <description>There are effectively (to me anyways) an infinite number of blog posts about the benefits and costs of pairing and what pairing is and isn&amp;rsquo;t. So I&amp;rsquo;m not going to talk about the good and bad of pairing. I&amp;rsquo;m going to assume that, like me, you want to pair and you see the benefits and costs. Instead today I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk about how I started experimenting with pairing at my most recent job.</description>
