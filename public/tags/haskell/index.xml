      <description>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a wonderful set of videos about Haskell during my lunch break. If you are interested in Haskell and functional programming I would definitely recommend the videos.
I found lecture 11 particularly interesting because of a paper that was written about the content here.
The paper is interesting because it shows how you can write a proof for an implementation of a problem in Haskell, then create transformations that speed up that implementation and prove that those transformations are also correct.</description>
