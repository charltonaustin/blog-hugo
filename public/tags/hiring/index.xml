      <description>History, what is it good for? When I interview someone I often ask, &amp;ldquo;Where did object oriented programming (OOP) come from?&amp;rdquo; There generally isn&amp;rsquo;t a right or wrong answer to this in the interview. You can go look up whether a particular answer is consistent with what&amp;rsquo;s on the internet. However you could give several answers that would all be right. You might say, &amp;ldquo;it was pioneered in Sketchpad.&amp;rdquo; Or you might say, &amp;ldquo;it came out of the atom in LISP.</description>
