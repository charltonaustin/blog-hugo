      <description>Recently ProtonMail came under a DDoS attack. I was unfortunately one of the people that was affected by this. A few years back after the [Snowden revelations I made a concerted effort to move away from services that cooperated with the NSA. That included companies like Google and Facebook. At the time ProtonMail popped up and I decided to try it out.
Now I&amp;rsquo;m no security expert, but a lot of the claims made by ProtonMail do seem a bit crazy.</description>
