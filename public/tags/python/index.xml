      <description>So fairly regularly I read about and dip into the python source code. For some reason there seems to be a great deal of beautiful and interesting code in both the c and the standard libraries and tests for python. The other day I was doing some reading about generators (I was thinking about how to marry the ideas of functional and object oriented programming) and I came across something that I found fascinating as well beautiful so I decided I should share it here on this silly little blog.</description>
