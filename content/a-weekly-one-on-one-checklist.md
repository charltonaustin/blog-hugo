## The checklist
1. How was last week?
1. Is there anything I need to know about that I don't know about?
1. Are you waiting on me for anything?
1. What can I do to make your life better?
1. Do you have any feedback for me?
1. Do you mind if we go over feedback for you?

## The reasoning
Each week I like to have a thirty minute one on one with all of my direct reports.
I know that can be a bit time demanding, but it isn't that bad.
If you imagine that you have 10 direct reports that translates into 300 minutes or 5 hours.
If you double that to make sure that you are prepared then you spend 10 hours.
That is roughly a quarter of your week managing people.
I think spending a quarter of your time is worth it for a few reasons.
That time lets you know what is going on with your employees.
It lets you address any feedback that you have for them in a timely manner.
It allows you to show your employees that you care about them.
If you miss one week it isn't a big deal.
Finally these are likely to be over estimates.
So it would be more accurate to say you are going to spend less than 25% of your time managing people.
Also realistically the most important aspect of any company these days is the quality of people you have.
So managers should be spending a good amount of time caring about their employees.

## Question One
>How was last week?

I generally ask this question to get a feel for where the employee is.
I try not to limit it to just work.
If an employee has a surgery coming up this is important to know.
I also don't push.
I simply try and understand where they are coming from.
If for some reason they don't want to talk about their life then I respect their privacy.
Also this question allows me to put their work into context.
It allows me to empathize with them.
Finally it can get the conversation going and allow them to open.

## Question Two and Three
> Is there anything I need to know about that I don't?
> 
> Are you waiting on me for anything?

These questions let the employee remind me of things they think are important.
I do this question first so they have the chance to get any burning ideas out.
It also allows them to tell me when they think I am missing something.

## Question Four
> What can I do to make your life better?

What can I say.
I want to make my employees lives better.
I try not to be judgemental here, but I make sure to be honest.
If they want a huge raise and the company can't afford it I don't react negatively.
I simply say we can't afford it, but I can bring it up with the rest of leadership.
This is a great chance to look for repeated questions.
In my mind repeated questions indicate that something is important to an employee.
It can also be an indication that you need to change something or the employee might leave.
Don't be afraid to dig here and really understand what the employee wants.
Sometimes an employee is asking for a raise because they want to feel more valued.
Other times they may be asking for a raise because they need more money.
In the first case offering something like more vacation time might be appropriate.
That probably won't work in the second case.

## Question Five and Six
> Do you have any feedback for me?
> 
>Do you mind if we go over some feedback for you?

I save the feedback for the end.
This allows us to focus on just the feedback since at this point hopefully we have covered everything else.
Also hopefully at this point the conversation is already warmed up.
No one wants to start a weekly one on one feeling attacked.
I usually let the employee go first.
I don't want them having to think of feedback when I give them feedback.
Also I usually write feedback down before we get into the conversation.
I do this for two reasons.
First I try and give feedback early and often.
So generally we have already talked about it.
Second I keep all of these questions and the notes from the conversation in a document that we both have access to.
That way the employee isn't surprised.
Also so that if there is a misunderstanding they can comment on it.
I use these notes to inform conversations about pay, promotions, reviews and whatever else might come up.
It feels only fair that employees have a chance to tell their side of the story.
One thing to know think about the last question is to listen if the employee doesn't want feedback.
Feedback can be hard to take at times.
Using your best judgement as to whether it will be effective to go over it is important.
Giving feedback when someone isn't really able to accept it is a waste of everyone's time.
Also it can lead to bad feelings on both sides.
