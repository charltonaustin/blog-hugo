## The reasoning
Each week I like to have a thirty minute one on one with all of my direct reports.
I know that can be a bit time demanding, but it isn't that bad.
If you imagine that you have 10 direct reports that translates into 300 minutes or 5 hours.
If you double that to make sure that you are prepared you spend 10 hours or roughly a quarter of your week managing people.
I think spending a quarter of your time is worth it for a few reasons.
That time lets you know what is going on with your employees.
It lets you address any feedback that you have for them in a timely manner.
It allows you to show your employees that you care about them.
If you miss one week it isn't a big deal.
Finally these are likely to be over estimates.
So it would be more accurate to say you are going to spend less than 25% of your time managing people.

## How to be time efficient and effective
I made a bunch of claims on how that time can be spent and what it means.
