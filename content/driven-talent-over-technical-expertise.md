# The problem
Hiring the right talent is critical for the success of any company. When I was starting my first startup, I hired two relatively inexperienced people, Hassan and Amelia, who turned out to be fantastic hires. Amelia was on her second career and had gone through a technology bootcamp, while Hassan had a master's of science in software engineering. They were both hardworking, driven, and willing to learn and grow. Despite their lack of experience, they made significant contributions to the company's success.

# What's important
I have also learned that technical expertise is not the only critical factor when making a hiring decision. When I hired people with deep technical experience but without knowing the tech stack, the company moved slower than when I hired Hassan and Amelia. This experience emphasized the importance of not only having technical expertise but also a deep understanding of the specific technologies and tools used by the company.

# Drive for the win
It's critical to consider an individual's drive when making a hiring decision. I have found that an employee who is motivated, driven, and eager to learn can make significant contributions to my company, even if they lack deep technical knowledge or experience.

# Intelligence over technical skill
Intelligence is another critical factor to consider when making a hiring decision. Individuals with high intelligence can learn technical skills quickly, and they often have a knack for problem-solving and critical thinking. However, intelligence alone may not be enough to ensure success. It's essential to look for employees who can apply their intelligence to the specific context of the company and who are motivated to learn and grow.

# Technical bars
When making a hiring decision, I have learned to strike the right balance between technical expertise and other factors, such as drive and intelligence. Hiring individuals with deep technical knowledge is undoubtedly critical for many roles, but it's equally important to look for individuals who are motivated, driven, and eager to learn. In fact, if I were to hire again, I would hire for intelligence and drive or deep technical knowledge and drive, with the latter being less critical than the drive.

# Finding the right balance
Ultimately, the combination of technical expertise, drive, and intelligence can help me build a strong and successful team. By hiring for these critical factors, I can create a team that is not only skilled and knowledgeable but also motivated, adaptable, and ready to tackle any challenge that comes their way.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, my experience has shown that when making a hiring decision, it's essential to look beyond technical expertise and consider other factors, such as drive and intelligence. Hiring individuals who are driven, intelligent, and eager to learn can make a significant difference in the success of my company. By striking the right balance between technical expertise and other factors, I can build a strong and dynamic team that is ready to take my company to new heights.
