1. **The value of continuous learning in a startup environment**  
   This post could focus on the importance of fostering a culture of continuous learning within my startup. I could discuss how I encourage my team to learn new skills and technologies, and how this has helped my company stay ahead of the curve. I could also share examples of how I've invested in my own learning as a founder, and how this has helped me make better decisions for my company.

2. **Navigating the challenges of remote startup teams**  
   In this post, I could discuss the unique challenges of building and managing a startup team that is distributed across different locations. I could share strategies for effective communication and collaboration, as well as tools and technologies that have helped me stay connected with my team. I could also talk about the benefits of remote teams, such as access to a broader talent pool and reduced overhead costs.
    1. Time zone differences: When team members are located in different time zones, scheduling meetings and collaborations can become more difficult.
    2. Difficulty establishing and maintaining a work-life balance: Without the physical separation between work and home that an office provides, it can be harder to switch off from work and relax.
    3. Technical issues: Poor internet connections, technical glitches, and other technology-related issues can make it difficult to work efficiently and collaboratively.
    4. Lack of supervision and support: Remote workers may feel isolated and disconnected from their colleagues and may struggle to get the support they need to perform at their best.
    5. Security concerns: Remote work can present security risks, such as data breaches and cyber attacks, that may be harder to detect and mitigate than in a traditional office setting.
3. Being strategic
   1. The essential skills for strategic leadership.
      1. Anticipate
         1. Think through what the end user is going to do.
         2. Look for changes in the environment.
            1. How has technology changed?
            2. How has user expectations chained?
            3. What is possible today that wasn't possible before?
      2. Challenge
         1. How does this compare with your expectations of a good end user product?
         2. Have you had someone other than yourself or your team give you feed back?
         3. Can you test this in any way to refute your expectations?
      3. Interpret
         1. Some of the data from challenging is likely to be inconclusive can you come up with different explanations as to why?
         2. When working on a feature focus zoom in and think to yourself does this work on it's own. Does it solve a customers problem?
         3. Then take the same feature and think about it from the whole systems' perspective. Does it make sense? Is it driving toward a coherent conclusion?
      4. Decide
         1. It is easy to get into a go/no go framework for a feature or solution resist this and spend time thinking through multiple options.
         2. You have to balance speed with a disciplined process. This can mean time-boxing exploration time, while still insisting on it.
      5. Align
         1. All decisions are made in the context of a team. Work to understand your team and get people on board. Do not make decisions without input from other people and socializing an idea.
         2. Use conversations with frameworks that make sense to you so that you can help expose any misalignment or problems with solutions.
      6. Learn
         1. Take time to learn frameworks and APIs.
         2. If you are fighting the technology ask yourself why and see if there is a better way to approach the problem given your specific context.
      7. I often write about alignment and autonomy in these articles I'm going to touch on why the USMC makes sure everyone is a leader and what that means from a strategic perspective for engineers.
4. Alignment from an engineers perspective
   1. What am I doing today and does it align with the company's or team's goals?
      1. For instance if you are building a feature does it align with the stated goals of the team or organization?
      2. Spend time trying to think through whether you should do it at all or if you can find something that works better.
   2. Ask yourself if my team were successful what would it look like?
      1. Are what are you doing going to contribute to that image?
      2. Do you know what other people on your team would consider success?
5. How engineers can improve their strategic approach to solving problems
   1. Ask their managers and teammates tough questions.
      1. For instance when picking up a feature ask yourself and others, "Is this the right feature? If I had this feature would the end user get the expected benefit of it?"
      2. Another good question would be "Is there another way to achieve this that is simpler?"
   2. Work to organize ideas simply and directly
      1. People have short attention spans working to simplify and to only focus on the most important parts is paramount.
      2. Make sure to clarify and think through how to communicate effectively with teammates and other stakeholders.
   3. Give yourself time to think through problems and solutions.
      1. I'm a big believer in making sure that you show that you are working while working remotely sometimes it can feel like you are not working when you are thinking so make sure to socialize those ideas. Write out your thoughts and get feedback from stakeholders.
      2. Spending time thinking about whether you are building the right thing or can build something that is simpler or more effective can have huge wins for your reputation and for your team's success.
6. Engineers should demonstrate their critical thinking for the success of the company and team.
