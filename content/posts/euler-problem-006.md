### The problem
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385 The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 552 = 3025 Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

#### Solution ####
The code is not that interesting. You simply walk from 1 to the number keeping track of the differences and return them in the end. Not a bad way to warm up for the day, but definitely isn't going to keep thinking forever.

```javascript
var findDifferenceOfSquares = function(number){
  var differences = [];
  var sum = 0;
  var sumOfSquares = 0;
  for(var i = 1; i < number + 1; i++) {
    sum += i;
    sumOfSquares += i * i;
    differences.push(sum*sum - sumOfSquares);
  }
  return differences;
}
```
