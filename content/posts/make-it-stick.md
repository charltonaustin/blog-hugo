## The book
[Make It Stick](https://www.amazon.com/Make-Stick-Science-Successful-Learning/dp/0674729013) is a brief review of the best methods for learning.
The book starts out by giving a brief overview of how teachers have tried to teach in the past and then turns to evidence based methods backed by science today.
There is some repetition in content, but I immediately tried to implement the practices in the book and found that it dramatically changed the way that I read and study.


## Best practices you should be following to learn more efficiently


## Study Helper
I have used Anki in the past and I have to say in order to remember things Anki is one of the best tools out there.
Recently though I've been learning how to spell in Korean and one thing I noticed is Anki is difficult for pieces of information that are hard to break down.
If you go to the Anki website the general advice is to simply break information into smaller chunks and to follow some of the best practices from this book.
But you can't always do that.
Consider trying to break a word down that you are learning to spell.
This is hard to break down.
I also find that most of my cards end up being leeches.
I could create a cloze, but I realized that creating a cloze means that I have to track the same information in multiple ways.
It makes the continuity of a card difficult.
So I thought to myself how can I bring the best practices of this book to the art of note cards.
All of a sudden the concept of Study Helper was born.
